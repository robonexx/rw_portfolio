# my portfolio
# HTML CSS VANILLA JS

So I will redo and continue with this one, started a while ago
Done many other projects, learned alot using scss, react, next.js, wordpress, headless cms, less, styled components, little vue etc

done some pure js projects, some pure css html without javascript
tried out jquery etc

And NOW THIS, will do my portfolio with pure everything this time
I have projects already showing react, next and so on

I have done an internshipt and learned a lot, going to my second education now learning more, goal is to be as good as possible
learn as much as I can and everntually land my dream job
just get to work with coding and learn more would be a priviledge

Forwards....
